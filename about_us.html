    <b>Our Story:</b><br>

     was born out of a vision to transform the way people explore Sri Lanka by train. Frustrated by the outdated methods of ticket booking and the challenges travelers faced, we set out to create a modern, user-friendly solution. Our founders, passionate about travel and technology, combined their expertise to bring this vision to life.
